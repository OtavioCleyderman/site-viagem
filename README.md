# Travel Agency Site

Hi! This is a project developed to practice knowledge in HTML and CSS, carried out following the steps contained in [this playlist,](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOUrDmh7c7mVzTETBVBerrMawaLd-4RMs)   from Isadora's channel, [Papo de Dev.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRhKK6VrISnIWPJjYxBPKnA)

The main objective here is to practice the basics of HTML and CSS so that I can develop myself, have my portfolio and improve it.

Nice things that could be learned from this project:
- Flexbox concepts
	- We covered the basic of flexbox, like: flex-direction, justify-content and align-items.
- How to integrate with google maps
	- The site contact section uses a map to show the address, for that we used google maps integration and documentation.
- Media queries
	- All the site is responsive for smartphones, tablets and desktops.
